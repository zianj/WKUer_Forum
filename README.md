# WKUer Forum

During the WKU's study, students always encouter with which courses or professors they need to choose. In order to provide a platform for students to find out their own satisfactory professors, this forum is developed.



## Week#1: Deposit the sample forum

To have a quick start, we want to start with a open source forum framework. After discussion, we choose  [nodeBB](https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB) as our base, because of its modern UI design, Node.js-based code and large community of developers.

The nodeBB also provides the development document which can help us to develop new plugins and add new fetures into it. Now the sample forum is deposited in my own server (click [here](http://frankjin.f3322.net:4080) for demo).
